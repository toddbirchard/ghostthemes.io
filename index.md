Premium themes for the [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) blogging platform  (by [Todd Birchard](https://github.com/toddbirchard)).

## Stockholm

[Stockholm](https://github.com/toddbirchard/ghosttheme-stockholm) is arguably the most feature-rich Ghost theme on the market. With some light configuration, users can extend their app's functionality by accessing data which would be otherwise inaccessible via Ghost, thus introducing a plethora of features and widgets. Users can personalize their themes via simple config files, enabling contextual widgets, fully integrated user sign ups, and unique page templates.

## Tokyo

[Tokyo](https://github.com/toddbirchard/ghosttheme-tokyo) is a minimalist Ghost theme emphasizing readability, load times, and customization. Stays true to a philosophy of simplicity while expanding on Ghost features to elevate authors.
